                    <h2>Sudhir Ruparelia</h2>
                    <p>Sudhir Ruparelia is a Ugandan business magnate and investor. He is the Chairman and majority shareholder in Ruparelia Group of Companies. 
                        His investments are mainly in the areas of banking, insurance, education, broadcasting, real estate, floriculture, hotels and resorts.</p>
                        
                    <p>He started building his empire in Uganda in 1985 after returning from the United Kingdom, when he went after being expelled from Uganda by then President Idi Amin in 1972 along with the other Asians in the country.</p>

                        <p>According to Forbes, he is reported to be the wealthiest individual in Uganda and the East African Community. In November 2013, he was reported to be the 24th wealthiest individual in Africa, with an estimated net worth of US$1.1 billion. 
                            But he is also a very social man and closely interacts with his clients and parents of all his education institutions. This is partly what gives his an edge over so many other investors in the country.</p>

                        <p>She has experience working in management and control of foreign exchange operations which she got while working in the UK as a manager with Express Travel Bureau and as a trainee banker with Midland Banking in its foreign exchange department.
                            She is a director in several of the family’s companies.</p>
                        <p>It is always every parent’s joy to see his or her child succeed in life. I educated my children and I have seen them succeed in their studies and get back to help using the running of the businesses. 
                            It is this kind quality of education that we are committed to be offering the children in this country. For instance, we are using smart boards in our classrooms. 
                            We are just a handful of schools in the country that have invested in this quality of technology in our classrooms.</p>
                        <p>Within just a few months, we have managed to grow the population of the school to 750 pupils. This means that in the next few years, we will have to expand the facilities of this school. 
                            We expect the population to go up and to have more Ugandan and expatriates’ children being enrolled in this school.</p>
                        <p>The parents should also be confident with the management of this school. As directors of the school, we are always involved in the operations of the school, to ensure that we maintain a very high quality of education.</p>
                        <p>We are sure that we have also employed the best team in the field of education to directly manage the day-to-day operations of the school.
                            A good number of parents are already appreciating what we are doing at this school.
                            We are offering quality education, at affordable fees, as part one of the ways of giving back to our people. This is unique and quality education.</p>

                            We want to train children who will later graduate and help this country’s economic growth. We have children of expatriates and other Ugandans in this school. Parents should not imagine that this school is only for Indians. 
                            We have made the school affordable, compared to all other international schools in the country. Much as we have hugely invested in the school, our main focus is to offer high quality revered education to all children who walk through our gate to this school.</p>
